Subject: Trouble with my new car

Hello,

I recently bought one of your XYZ 2023 models, but I've been having some issues with it.

I was thrilled when I first got the car, it ran smoothly and I was quite satisfied with my purchase.
However, just a few days in, I started noticing a strange grinding noise whenever I accelerated.
I tried to look for any visible problems, but couldn't find anything.

This issue is quite distressing as I bought the car brand new and did not expect to have such problems so soon.
I hope you can help me resolve this issue.

Best regards,
John Smith
